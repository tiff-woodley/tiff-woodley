<!--### Hi there ðŸ‘‹-->

As cliche as it may sound, I am a problem solver. Having a background in electrical and electronic engineering, I have thoroughly enjoyed finding data solutions within the industry. Looking forward I am eager to apply my new learnt skills in machine learning across multiple industries. I strongly believe in Occamâ€™s Razor â€“ the simplest explanation is usually the best one - and love using this principle and a bit of creativity to find novel ways to solve complex problems.
