<!--### Hi there ðŸ‘‹-->

I am a natural problem-solver and strongly believe in Occamâ€™s Razor â€“ the simplest explanation is usually the best one. I love using this principle and a bit of creativity to find novel ways to solve complex problems. With a background in electrical and electronic engineering, I have thoroughly enjoyed finding data solutions within the industry and I am eager to apply my range of skills in machine learning across multiple industries.
